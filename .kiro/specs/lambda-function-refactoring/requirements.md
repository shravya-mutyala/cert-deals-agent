# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current lambda_function.py file has grown to over 1000 lines and handles multiple responsibilities including search integration, web scraping, database operations, user management, and analytics. This monolithic structure makes the code difficult to maintain, test, and extend. The goal is to refactor this into a modular, maintainable architecture while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the certification deals system, I want the lambda function to be broken into smaller, focused modules, so that I can easily understand, test, and modify specific functionality without affecting other parts of the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the lambda function is refactored THEN it SHALL be split into separate modules with single responsibilities
2. WHEN a module is modified THEN it SHALL NOT require changes to unrelated modules
3. WHEN new functionality is added THEN it SHALL be possible to add it without modifying existing core modules
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the main lambda_function.py SHALL be under 200 lines

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working on search functionality, I want search-related code to be in its own module, so that I can focus on search improvements without navigating through unrelated code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search functionality is needed THEN it SHALL be contained in a dedicated search module
2. WHEN Google Custom Search API is used THEN it SHALL be abstracted behind a clean interface
3. WHEN search queries are enhanced THEN the logic SHALL be contained within the search module
4. WHEN search results are formatted THEN the formatting logic SHALL be separate from the API calls

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working on data persistence, I want database operations to be centralized in a repository pattern, so that I can modify data access logic without affecting business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is stored or retrieved THEN it SHALL go through a repository interface
2. WHEN DynamoDB operations are performed THEN they SHALL be abstracted behind repository methods
3. WHEN data conversion is needed THEN it SHALL be handled within the repository layer
4. WHEN database errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled consistently across all operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer adding new deal sources, I want web scraping functionality to be modular and extensible, so that I can add new providers without modifying existing scraper code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new provider is added THEN it SHALL be possible to add a new scraper without modifying existing ones
2. WHEN scraping fails THEN fallback mechanisms SHALL be handled consistently
3. WHEN scraper logic is modified THEN it SHALL NOT affect other scrapers
4. WHEN deal data is extracted THEN it SHALL follow a consistent interface across all scrapers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working on user features, I want user management functionality to be separate from deal discovery, so that I can modify user-related features independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user profiles are managed THEN it SHALL be handled by a dedicated user service
2. WHEN user recommendations are generated THEN the logic SHALL be separate from deal discovery
3. WHEN user data is accessed THEN it SHALL go through a consistent user repository interface
4. WHEN user preferences are updated THEN it SHALL NOT affect deal discovery logic

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want proper error handling and logging to be consistent across all modules, so that I can easily debug issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in any module THEN they SHALL be logged consistently
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN retry logic SHALL be handled uniformly
3. WHEN exceptions are raised THEN they SHALL include sufficient context for debugging
4. WHEN the system operates normally THEN appropriate info logs SHALL be generated

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer testing the system, I want each module to be independently testable, so that I can write focused unit tests and ensure code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules are created THEN they SHALL have minimal dependencies on other modules
2. WHEN testing is performed THEN each module SHALL be testable in isolation
3. WHEN dependencies exist THEN they SHALL be injectable for testing purposes
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN test coverage SHALL be maintainable per module
