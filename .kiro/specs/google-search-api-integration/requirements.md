# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing certification deals hunter application by replacing direct website scraping with Google Search API integration. The enhancement will provide more current, comprehensive, and reliable results for both the main deals discovery agent and the interactive chat agent. The system will search for certification deals, format and summarize results, and ensure only the most recent deals (2025 and forward) are presented to users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user searching for certification deals, I want the system to use Google Search API instead of scraping specific websites, so that I get more comprehensive and current results from across the web.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system discovers deals THEN it SHALL use Google Search API to search for certification deals instead of scraping specific provider websites
2. WHEN searching for deals THEN the system SHALL query multiple search terms related to certification discounts, vouchers, and promotions
3. WHEN processing search results THEN the system SHALL extract relevant deal information from search result snippets and titles
4. IF Google Search API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to the current scraping method with appropriate error handling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see only current and relevant deals from 2025 onwards, so that I don't waste time on expired or outdated offers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN filtering search results THEN the system SHALL exclude deals that mention dates from 2024 or earlier
2. WHEN processing deal information THEN the system SHALL prioritize results that explicitly mention 2025 or current year
3. WHEN no date is found in a deal THEN the system SHALL include it but mark it with lower confidence score
4. WHEN displaying deals THEN the system SHALL sort results by recency and relevance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to format and summarize search results clearly, so that I can quickly understand the deal details and access the source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing search results THEN the system SHALL extract key information including discount amount, provider, certification name, and eligibility
2. WHEN a deal is found THEN the system SHALL include the original source URL from the search result
3. WHEN summarizing deals THEN the system SHALL provide a confidence score based on information completeness and source reliability
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL format deals consistently with provider, discount, price, and source link

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the chat agent, I want it to use the same Google Search API functionality, so that I get consistent and current results whether I use the main interface or chat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the chat agent THEN it SHALL use the same Google Search API integration for deal discovery
2. WHEN asked about deals in chat THEN the system SHALL provide formatted summaries with source links
3. WHEN chat agent searches for deals THEN it SHALL apply the same date filtering and relevance scoring
4. WHEN providing chat responses THEN the system SHALL include source URLs for verification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and fallback mechanisms, so that the application remains functional even when Google Search API has issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google Search API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN Google Search API is completely unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to the existing scraping method
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN fallback is used THEN the system SHALL notify users that results may be limited

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Google Search API integration to be configurable and secure, so that API keys are protected and search parameters can be adjusted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN Google Search API credentials SHALL be stored as environment variables
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use proper authentication and handle API quotas
3. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of search parameters like result count and search terms
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL validate that required API credentials are present
